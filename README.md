# mt-flappy
Flappy-bird clone with an edge. Created with libgdx framework

This was a small project for a java class at mtsu
A very funny class with no coursework for the first month 
because the professor was struggling to get the jre updated adequately

needless to say, it was an easy a with this final project.
